                                <p>We can back up your schools server(s) remotely to a secure offsite location removing the headache and risk of changing tapes on a daily basis. Your vital data is encrypted, stored offsite and easily retrievable, which will help you to be more productive. We can back up MIS and curriculum data.</p>
                                <p>Remote backup will give you the following benefits:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>No special technical knowledge needed or costly hardware to buy.</li>
                                    <li>Backups are scheduled to happen automatically, saving you time and effort.</li>
                                    <li>Backups take place during school holidays and weekends, if users are working on your systems remotely, their data is still backed up – where traditionally conventional backup tapes aren’t changed.</li>
                                    <li>Your schools data is transmitted and stored in an encrypted state, to give you confidence that it cannot be accessed by anyone else.</li>
                                    <li>Incremental backups mean the service only uses as much bandwidth on your network as is absolutely necessary.</li>
                                    <li>Your data is saved or ‘backed up’ automatically over night to minimise disruption during school hours.</li>
                                    <li>Backups – as well as being encrypted are stored in a physically secure, UK data centre, for even greater protection, an additional copy is stored in another separate secure UK data centre.</li>
                                    <li>Backup data is retained for 1 calendar month.</li>
                                </ul>
