                            <p>We offer a comprehensive range of services and high quality technical support for ICT systems. Our services are designed around FITS (Framework for ICT Technical Support) we can help you implement this in your establishment.</p>
                            <p>Would you prefer a visits only service? Our offerings are flexible, buy as much or as little support as you feel you need, for a service thatâ€™s designed around you. If telephone and remote support does not fit your needs, there is no obligation to buy it, we can offer a visits only service, or a combination of the two depending on your requirements.</p>
                            <p>Our visits can be structured into regular maintenance visits, or a bank of callout time to use when you need it most.</p>
