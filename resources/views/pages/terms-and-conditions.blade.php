The Contract Holder must also provide access to those areas of the Network as required by LA ICT for LA ICT to deliver the Services.</p>

                                <p>The Contract Holder must nominate an “appointed contact” and a maximum of two additional contacts who will act as the liaison between the Contract Holder’s establishment and LA ICT.</p>

                                <p>Advance knowledge of planned changes will ensure that LA ICT engineers have current information on the status of the Network, helping LA ICT to resolve issues affecting the Network more efficiently. LA ICT considers strategic changes to be changes that significantly alter the Network including:</p>

                                <li><strong>2.1</strong> The term for each Support Contract shall be as agreed between the parties but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be deemed to have commenced until LA ICT accepts the relevant order.</li>
                                <li><strong>2.2</strong> The Services shall commence on the date referred to in Condition 2.1 (above) and shall continue initially for twelve (12) months. No refunds shall be payable if the Customer seeks to terminate any Agreement within any such minimum term (including any renewal thereof) unless LA ICT agrees (in its absolute discretion) to make such refund.</li>
                                <li><strong>2.3</strong> The start date of the delivery of any Product shall not be guaranteed but LA ICT shall use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that the commencement of the delivery of the Product shall be as agreed.</li>
                                <li><strong>2.4</strong> Where LA ICT agrees to perform any work by a particular date, that date shall not be guaranteed and LA ICT shall not be liable for any failure to meet such date or dates.</li>

All prices are exclusive of Value Added Tax (and any similar tax) which will be added as separate items on LA ICT’s invoice.</p>

                                <ul>
                                <li><strong>4.1</strong> Unless otherwise notified to the Contract Holder in writing by LA ICT, the Contract Holder shall pay all invoices within thirty (30) days of the date thereof (time being of the essence).

Our top-ups are available in a choice of options ranging from 10GB to 100GB and have no expiry date. They are only lost if the Contract Holder moves to an alternative service provider or LA ICT’s Partner or ceases the connection. As the limit is reached the Contract Holder is notified by email</p>

                                <p>Save as expressly otherwise agreed in writing, the Contract Holder shall be responsible for the care and maintenance of all equipment required for the operation of any Product. Any damage to, or loss of, any such equipment shall be the exclusive responsibility of the Contract Holder&nbsp; save where such damage is expressly stated within these Conditions to be LA ICT’s responsibility.</p>
